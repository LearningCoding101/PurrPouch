## ‚úÖ Notes

- All entities use Lombok annotations: `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@NoArgsConstructor`
- `createdAt` fields use `LocalDateTime.now()` as default
- Add `@JsonIgnore` where needed to prevent circular references in JSON responses
- Business logic and calculations (e.g., price per meal or per kit) should be handled in service classes
